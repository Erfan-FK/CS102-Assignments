CS102 - CardGame homework
=========================

This folder contains all the classes for the card game we designed in lectures.

If you are using VS Code, simply open the folder cardgame_homework
provided to you on Moodle, and complete the implementation of all
classes according to the comments following the design done in
lectures.

If you are using a different IDE, simply copy all .java files as necessary
(note the src folder contains only the java source files, 
 the classes folder contains only the .class files).

You can find the lecture slides with the design on Moodle, "Slide Set 3".

Your task is to complete the game. First make sure the project
compiles and the CardGameTest class runs (ignore MyCardGame until
everything else is working).

Take a look at each of the Java classes, see how they correspond to the design. 
You will see many methods are left for you "ToDo" -- that's your homework!

This is a graded homework and must be done individually. 
You should also write your reflections on the process as a text file "Reflections.txt",
this should be at least 100 words. Create and upload an "HW3_lastname_name.zip" file
containing both the completed CardGame code and your reflections. Upload your solution
to the moodle homework activity by the specified due date.

If you have any questions related to this homework, please ask on the course forum.

Good luck.
